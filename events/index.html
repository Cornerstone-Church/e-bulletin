                <p>
                    It's not too late to be a part of changing the lives of children in India. Each person is asked
                    to give one day's wage to feed impoverished and hurting children in Calcutta. For as little as
                    $6, we can feed a child for one month. Please pray & do your part as we feed nearly 2,000
                    children every day for 1 year. You can also give online at <a target="_blank" href="cag.org/give">cag.org/give</a>,
                    One Day to Feed the
                    World or give using an envelope from the Welcome Center.
